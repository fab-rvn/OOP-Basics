# What is object-oriented programming in general terms?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

# What is a class?
In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (properties) and implementations of behavior (methods).

# What is an object?
In the object-oriented programming paradigm object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
In class-based variation of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class.

# What is an instance?
In a computer system, any time a new context is created based on some model, it is said that the model has been instantiated. This instance usually has a data structure in common with other instances, but the values stored in the instances are separate.

# What is a property?
We call properties to the variables inside a class. Properties can accept values like strings, integers, and booleans, like any other variable.

# What is a method?
A method in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated with a class. A method defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class. Another way to say this is that a method is an action that an object is able to perform. The association between method and class is called binding.

# What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method, like a function, is a set of instructions that perform a task. The difference is that a method is associated with an object, while a function is not.

# What is a constructor?
In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special type of subroutine called to initialize an object's properties.

# What is the difference between a class, an object and an instance?
A class is a blueprint which you use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class that you made using a specific class. Instance and object and are the same thing, but the word 'instance' indicates the relationship of an object to its class.

# What do we understand by the concept of encapsulation?
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on data within one unit, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

# What do we understand by the concept of abstraction?
Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity.

# What do we understand by the concept of inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. Hence, inheritance facilitates reusability and is an important concept of OOP.

# What do we understand by the concept of polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types. Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.

# What do we understand by the concept of Overload?
Overloading a method simply means two or more methods have the same method name with different arguments or parameters(compulsory) and return type.

# What do we understand by the concept of Override?
Overriding a method simply means that a subclass redefines its inherited method(s) when it needs to change or extend the behavior of that method.

# What differences exist between the concept of Overload and Override?

# What is a static class?
Static classes are sealed and therefore cannot be inherited. They cannot inherit from any class except Object. Static classes cannot contain an instance constructor. However, they can contain a static constructor.

# Look for 3 advantages over object-oriented programming compared to other programming paradigms
 - Modularity for easier troubleshooting
 - Reuse of code through inheritance
 - Flexibility through polymorphism
 - Effective problem solving

# Look for disadvantages of this paradigm.
 - Steep learning curve
 - The complexity of creating programs
